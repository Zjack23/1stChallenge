Code Refactor README

I Replaced non-semantic div elements in the html with elements such as header, nav, section, main, article, and footer.
I Added accessible alt attributes to all images.
I Ensured heading elements are in sequential order (h1, h2, h3).
Then Updated the title element to be more descriptive and concise.

I took a look at the CSS to match the HTML elements, I Replaced .header with header and updated corresponding styles.
Replaced .header div with nav and updated corresponding styles.
Replaced .content with main.
Replaced section-specific classes (.search-engine-optimization, .online-reputation-management, .social-media-marketing) with #search-engine-optimization, #online-reputation-management, #social-media-marketing to match the IDs used in the HTML.
